# Code formatting
The extension provides code formatting for BrightScript and BrighterScript files. If you don't like the default formatter settings, you can customize them in two ways: 
1. Update your user or workspace settings with various `brightscript.format.*` options (see the [extension settings](../extension-settings.html) page for more info).

2. Create a `bsfmt.json` file at the root of your project. See all of the available `bsfmt.json` options [here](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript-formatter#bsfmtjson-options). Please note, if a `bsfmt.json` file exists, all formatter-related user/workspace settings will be ignored.
